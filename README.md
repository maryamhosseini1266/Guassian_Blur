# 🎯Guassian Blur - A Simple Python Project
This project is a *very simple and beginner-friendly implementation of Guassian Blur* using python.
Guassian Blur is an common image processing technique used to *smooth images and reduce noise* by averaging pixel values whith a Guassian (normal) distribution.

## 📌What is Guassian Blur?
Guassian Blur app;ies a soft blur effect to an image by giving *more weight to nearby pixels* and *less weight to distant pixels*.
The result is a *natural and smooth blur*, unlike simple averaging.

## ⚒️Tools & Teschnologies
*.* Python
*.* OpenCV(cv2)
*.* Basic image processing concepts


## 🚀How It Works

1.Read an input image
2.Apply Guassian Blur using a Guassian Kernel
3.Display the original and blurred images

The blur intensity can be easily changed by modifying the kernel size.
